## Robots
This year our team created 2 robots!

Our version 2 robot is a huge step forward from our last robot. This robot took over 10 different CAD iterations and 3D prints to make the lift work consistently while fitting inside the needed size constraints. Although this robot took a lot of time and effort to finish, this paid off in the end as this robot has better consistency and improved features.
