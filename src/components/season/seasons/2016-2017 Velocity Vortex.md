# Our Robot - 2016-17 Velocity Vortex Season:

Our robot has gone through many different software changes, designs, and redesigns, but through all of it our main strategy has stayed the same. At the beginning of our season we brainstormed what our strategy should be. We considered all of our flaws in last year's strategies and also the few scoring elements in this year's game, and its heavy focus on autonomous. Our strategy for TeleOp is to be good at all three components of this year's game. Considering there are only three ways to score we decided that it would be possible to design a robot that would be able to do everything well. We started with shooting, and once we finished making our shooting mechanism we added a beacon pusher. While adding all these we have kept in mind the fact that later in the season we will be adding a cap ball mechanism. Doing some of everything allows us to be compatible with all other teams, allowing both us and our alliance partner to perform as well as they can. However, at the beginning of the season we knew we would need something to carry us through to the regional tournament, our autonomous. For this year we bought a whole bunch of new sensors including a color sensor, ultrasonic sensor, and a light sensor. We used these to create a consistent, high scoring autonomous. In the first thirty seconds of a match we are able to shoot two "particles" (whiffle balls), hit two beacons to the correct color, and park on either the center or corner vortex, depending on what our partner does. Our autonomous program can consistently score 100 points without breaking a sweat.

Once we had a good strategy, it was time to build. Our robot mechanisms have gone through many complete redesigns including our shooting mechanism, collection mechanism and even our chassis.

In October, we brainstormed different ideas for how to launch the balls into the center vortex, and how to collect them. We started building a launching mechanism similar in design to a baseball pitching machine.

We then tried adding a barrel to the end to direct the ball and make it more accurate.   This design was kept till early November when we began work on a new catapult idea. At this time our team also began work on the chassis.

For the chassis we attempted a "U" shaped design in order to make it easier to collect the balls later on. However this design proved to be flimsy and unstable so we added a cross beam to the front to secure the chassis.

We continued to work and improve on our original ball launcher idea, but a prototype of a catapult kind of launcher was also worked on.

Between the pitching machine launcher and the catapult launcher, we concluded that the catapult was the more efficient and consistent option. We decided to try a Fibonacci curve, which looks like a snail shell, as the shape for the cam.  Then, when we had calculated the proportions needed, we copied it out on wood, drilled a hole in the middle, and sawed it out.  Finally, we mounted a hub to it, mounted it to the robot, and tested it using the battery from Jacob's drill.  It worked perfectly!

The finished project.

The chassis went through many changes, but we kept the same basic design. We decided to go with mecanum wheels for more mobility. However the mecanum wheels had a different shape than our old wheels so we had to change our chassis a bit to adjust for them.

Our first collection mechanism was a claw with two painter's tape rolls on the sides to clamp down on the ball. This collector was extremely inefficient, but it got us through Meet 0 and Meet 1.

![](src/components/season/season-assets/sharpEdgedPusher.png)

This was our first beacon pusher. It wasn't very effective, and it also caused us issues in robot inspection for its "Exposed sharp edges".

The robot finally all came together, and we began testing.

![](src/components/season/season-assets/fixingMecanumChassis.png)

We deconstructed our robot, because we saw that our mecanum wheels weren't working. At first we thought that it was a weight distribution problem, but after testing it we saw it made little to no difference. We concluded that the problem wasn't the weight distribution, but it may be a problem with the cleanliness and/or design of our wheels. We cleaned our wheels, but after testing, again, we saw that there was little to no difference. We finally concluded we need to purchase a gyro sensor, in order to be able to move sideways with the mecanum wheels and do that correctly.

We built a new beacon pusher that was much easier for driver to hit the beacon, due to its large surface area.

![](src/components/season/season-assets/prototypeCollector.png)

We saw during competition that our claw collection mechanism had some flaws. It could not hold more than two balls at a time, it took too long to collect, and it was very challenging for the driver to line up with the ball just right. We made a prototype of a new collector that could hold 3 balls and could collect them with ease. We debated on whether the collector should be run on friction or should have flaps to help the ball go into the shooter.

 The collection mechanism is completed and put on the robot. Only minor changes have to be done to compensate for the new collector.

![](src/components/season/season-assets/corkedBeaconPusher.png)

This is the beacon pusher for autonomous.  It has cork on it and is connected to a servo. Above that is a color sensor to see what button it has to hit, corresponding to the given alliance. 

This is the finished robot at this point in time.

![](src/components/season/season-assets/pistonShooterCAD.JPG)

Some work has been done on a new shooter design. This design would shoot the ball by using a piston powered by a spring contained in a cylinder.  The ball would ideally be launched at an almost vertical angle. This would allow the drivers to align themselves with the center vortex much more easily. In theory this design should also improve consistency as well as speed. This would allow us to score more points during the driver control period.

We also plan to have a cap ball mechanism.  At first, we put this off because it seemed too hard to do for only 40 points, but now, after working on other parts of the game, and seeing how other robots went about raising the cap ball, as well as seeing its effects on the competition points, we started to plan our own.  We bought drawer sliders to use because they are the only mechanism that is sturdy and small enough to fit and function on our robot.  After the Inter-League Tournament, we will add it to our robot.

# Our Story - 2016-17 Velocity Vortex Season:

Brain Stormz began this year on a better foot.  Though one team member dropped out, four more people joined, so we started the season with seven robot-loving team members. In addition, last year's team members knew the programming language, were familiar with the robot parts, and worked to familiarize the new team members with the ins and outs of FTC and robots. Overall, we were off to a great start.

As soon as the game was unveiled, we started to work.  We decided our priorities would be the center vortex, then the beacons, and began to strategize collection and shooting mechanisms, as well as what kind of chassis would be best.  First, there was the prototyping phase, where we explored and built our ideas separate from the robot itself.  A Hot Wheels-type shooter was our first idea, but after making a prototype of it, we realized it would take too many motors and too much space on the robot, so we discarded it for a smaller catapult design that utilized a team bracelet for spring power, and a cam shaped like a Fibonacci curve for an easy reload.

With the chassis, we had a rougher start.  We couldn't really decide what worked, so we ended up building and rebuilding the chassis two or three times.  Then, the team started thinking that they wanted more than the standard drive wheels, say omni wheels or even mecanum wheels.  Eventually, after much discussion, we decided that it would be best to shoot for getting mecanum wheels, but to start with regular wheels and a versatile chassis that would be able to convert to mecanum easily.  For the collection mechanism, our first idea came later on in the season.  It consisted of two "arms", each having an empty painter's tape roll attached to the end of them, by which we could grab the ball and transport it to our catapult in order to shoot.

Finally, the week before League Meet 0, our robot started coming together. We assembled the robot and immediately started on programming the autonomous and practicing driving. Unfortunately, our mecanum wheels were not functioning properly; we had a limited range of movement. But, when Meet 0 came, we were ready.  As this was a practice meet, we switched out which teammates were the coach and drivers to see who was the best at these positions. The robot worked well, but we definitely had a lot of work ahead of us. We also learned that we needed to put more of our focus on the beacons, especially in autonomous, where a team could get a 100 point lead in only 30 seconds!

Excited and inspired, we went right to work.  Between Meet 0 and Meet 1, we added a beacon-pusher to our robot.  We also changed out the speed gear ratio for a one to one ratio in our mecanum wheels in order to fix our inability to move side to side, as well as taking them apart and cleaning them.  However, these measures did not solve our problem.  On the positive side, we reinforced our robot and worked on programming for the autonomous period of the game.

In Meet 1, we performed much better.  While we were not prepared to push beacons in autonomous yet and had some wiring issues, we did improve our score by pushing them in TeleOp.  Between Meet 1 and Meet 2, we worked on wiring solutions, printed and implemented a 3D case for our phone, and built a new collection mechanism, after the standard FTC form.  Our work really paid off and in Meet 2, we improved our score greatly, hitting two beacons in autonomous and hitting beacons and shooting balls in TeleOp.  However, our first match failed because of a programming error in the autonomous shooting, but we did well on the rest of our matches.  Meet 3 went even better.  Unfortunately, we had a wiring problem, and failed our first match again, but we came back and won all the rest of our matches.  The league meets were a really good experience for us to get the feel for the strategy and game this year.

We looked forward to competing in the Inter-league Tournament. As for future design, we began to design a smaller shooter that will fire faster, as well as a mechanism to lift the cap ball.

#### **The First Tournament**

At last, the league meets had ended and we found ourselves at our Inter-League tournament. When we arrived, we did not know the competition all that well, so we began scouting teams for potential partners or teams to watch out for on the field. Some robots had the same "jack of all trades" strategy, while others had a much more specialized approach. During the morning, we met up with several teams we knew from our league meets, such as Rock and Roll robotics, Heat it Up and Keep it Cool, and Team Torch. We also got to know one of the most powerful players in the tournament, Rise of Hephaestus.

After passing robot and field inspection, we headed off to judging. After practicing a while in front of our coaches and families, we felt prepared to answer any question the judges could throw at us. We left the room feeling relieved and energized for the day ahead. Well, after eating lunch, that is.

Now, it was time for our robot to compete. While our first round was plagued by the all too familiar disconnect midway through TeleOp, we still managed to pull out of it with a win thanks to our autonomous and our alliance partner's cap ball lifter. The next few matches were also solid, except for one where both our alliance partner and our opponent accidentally selected the opposite color beacon, canceling both out! At the end of the seeding matches, we placed 1st in the competition, meaning we would have to choose our alliance as captains. After meeting as a team to discuss our picks, we chose on the two teams that would best fit our autonomous and were very strong together, because they would have to compete together, too. Our representative, Nathan, chose the teams Rise of Hephaestus and Rock and Roll Robotics during alliance selection, sending us into finals with a very strong alliance.

We hurried over to the alliance area to meet with Rise of Hephaestus and Rock and Roll to discuss strategy. We decided that we would run our robot with Rise of Hephaestus for the first round. After a high scoring first round, we won our first match, but our robot didn't seem to be working all that well after that match. We had to make a swap out, and so we decided to sit out of this next match and have Rise of Hephaestus and Rock and Roll run their robots together. Rise's autonomous worked perfectly, and we had another victory under our belt. It was time for us to square up against the second placed alliance!

Our first match was very close, as both teams capped the ball. Luckily, we were able to score more particles in the center vortex, and our alliance took the first round. The second round, however, did not work very well. We were now 1-1, and headed into the tiebreaker. Still, our robot was not up to the task, so we had Rise of Hephaestus run once again with Rock and Roll for the final match of the tournament. We held onto our seats in the audience and in the alliance area, waiting for the scores to come out of a very close match. The phrase "RED ALLIANCE WINS" came onto the board, and we all cheered! After handshakes with the other teams, we settled back into our seats for awards.

After waiting a while in the auditorium, the award ceremony began. We got to go up with our alliance to receive our winning alliance medals, and we also were given the Control Award! We also received a nomination for the PTC Design Award, second place. Once we had taken some pictures, it was time to head home, and prepare for Regionals competition!

#### Preparation and Inspiration

Our victory at ILT left us quite a happy team indeed. As we left our first tournament of the season, we had already begun discussing what to put on the robot. Did we want more beacon pushers? Should we switch out our catapult design for something new? Was it time to work on the cap ball? Ultimately, we decided that, since we didn't have much time before Regionals (3 weeks, to be exact), it would be quite difficult to implement so much onto the robot in so little time. It would be FRC levels of engineering! So, we decided to make small improvements, such as making a shock absorber for the catapult, find a better conveyor belt for our collection mechanism, and completely clean out the wheels and gears on the drive train. This would be a much needed "pit stop" for our robot, but that wasn't all we needed to do.

Our presentation during judging was good, but it could definitely use some improvement. We practiced our presentation multiple times in the robot lab, coming up with some good jokes and insightful improvements to our then existing script. We simulated interviews and found some good answers to the most expected questions.

During this 3 week period, one of our team members made a discovery. He found a way to compact our shooter so we could fit a trough for particles in our robot. After working with another engineer, he prototyped a basic spring-loaded launcher, that could, in theory, replace our bulky catapult mechanism without much change in our driving. Ultimately, we decided to not implement this design, mainly because we could never get it out of the prototype phase. Such a design required a large motor to turn the gears, something that we could not afford at that time, both monetarily and in regards to space on the robot. We still kept the design and brought it to tournaments, hoping that one day we would be able to use it.

#### Los Angeles Regional

We were proud of our robot and the work that went into it, and now it was time to test it on the field at our second tournament: the Los Angeles Regional. After going through robot and field inspection smoothly, we prepared for our early spot for judging. We reviewed our presentation with our coaches, and headed off to the judging room. The questions we received were more challenging than those from the last tournament, which was to be expected from a higher level of competition for awards. We left the room with confidence, and we gave each other notes on our performance. Most of us went back to man the booth, while our two drivers and coach went to attend the driver meeting.

Our practice round went worse than expected, as our autonomous malfunctioned, giving our opponents an extra particle and 30 points. Fortunately, it was an easy, albeit annoying, fix: drive train issues. This got us thinking if we should make our drive train simpler, or at least more accessible so we could tighten it easier. We made a note of it and headed into our first scored round.

After taking a decisive victory due to our now functioning autonomous, we met up with some teams that we knew. Rise of Hephaestus, Heat It Up and Keep It Cool, and Marlbots were all there. We asked them about their strategies, how their season was going, and any problems they had encountered on the way. One thing that we heard consistently was that the cap ball was a very difficult mechanism to attach without drastically affecting the way the robot controls. Teams told us about many long hours their drive teams spent just getting used to the sluggish and unpredictable movement caused by adding a cap ball mechanism. We took this into consideration, as we also wanted to add the cap ball later in the season.

Our next four matches were quite solid, winning three and loosing one, putting us in third place after seeding. Before alliance selection, we talked strategy with several other teams and our own, depending on which teams selected us. Our representative Nathan accepted Marlbots' invitation to join their alliance, and we headed into the finals with FusionYX (pronounced fusionics) as our second teammate.

Our first match-up went perfectly: no mistakes. We performed well, and went to the semifinals. It was time for our toughest matches so far in the season. Our opponents were Team Torch, a veteran, world class team, and Rise of Hephaestus, perhaps the most well-rounded robot in the competition. Needless to say, we couldn't afford to make any mistakes. Our first round was close, but due to a slight error in the other team's programming, we gained 30 extra points, giving us a win. Our second round was not so; with our opponents running at full capacity, they could shoot faster and more accurately than Marlbots and FusionYX could, giving them the victory in that round. Now, it was down to the wire, as whichever team won this next round was guaranteed a spot at the Super Regionals in Tacoma, Washington. Marlbots decided to run their robot with ours, with us running our autonomous. As we sat in the bleachers, we hoped that our drive train was tight enough, and our program began. It worked! Both of our beacons were red, and all three particles were scored! A perfect autonomous was then followed by a neck-and-neck driver control period. Whenever we could interrupt a shot, we took the opportunity, and we scored many particles. During endgame, Marlbots and Rise of Hephaestus raced for the cap balls, and after a tense 30 seconds, both cap balls were in their respective scoring positions. This one was going to come down to ten, maybe five points. The announcement came. We looked at the scoreboard. It updated. "Final score: 230-225. RED TEAM WINS!" the scoreboard showed. We cheered! It was final, we were going to Tacoma! It was time to head home and get ready for Super Regionals!

#### Preparing for Super Regionals

Although we were very pleased with our success at Regionals and our chance to go to the Super Regional Championship, we wanted to go further, to Worlds. To do that, we knew we needed to make significant improvements before Super Regionals, so we decided to work on improving our shooter and our driving, as well as our cap ball mechanism.

During this period, our drivers met often, greatly improving their skill at controlling to the robot. We also widened our collector area some, to improve the ease with which we could collect the particles. We continued working on various tweaks to ensure that our robot performed as well as possible at this competition, since this was our one shot at Worlds.

For the shooter, we worked on designing a compact, piston-like mechanism in CAD, which we built with the help of a local machinist. This, we hoped, would lessen the shooter's violent jolting of our robot and therefore make our shooting more accurate and efficient. A group of the team members also started machining a cap ball lifter constructed of drawer slides attached together by blocks of aluminum, so that they would extend to allow the cap ball to be dropped on top of the center vortex. However, neither of the two new mechanisms were ready to be put on the robot by Super Regionals, so we had to be content with the smaller improvements in both robot and driving.

#### Super Regionals

At the competition in Washington, we struggled through several unexpected problems with our robot, but still did well, competing against some of the top teams at the tournament, and even getting picked for an alliance. As a result, we qualified for the World Championship!

#### Preparing for Worlds

Between these two top tournaments was a hectic few weeks, which found our team making a radical decision. We had made it to the last tournament of the season, the hardest and the best one there is. Yet, as we strategized and considered our robot, we realized that a mediocre robot like we had would make it only a short way in the competitive World Championship. The last thing we wanted to be was a mediocre team, so, with only a few weeks ahead, we made the decision to totally rebuild our robot in order to move its performance beyond mediocre and make it a robot worthy and capable of competing with world-class robots. Our plan was to rearrange and improve the mechanisms on our robot and make room for the cap ball mechanism that was still in the works, as well as a mechanism to move the balls from the collector to the shooter more effectively. One week went by. Then another. The mechanism for delivering balls from the collector to the shooter was built and we found it greatly increased our efficiency. However, the cap ball mechanism was progressing far slower. Time was running out. Finally, we were forced to make a difficult decision. Things weren't going as quickly as planned. The robot was nearly done and the drivers needed to practice, but we had not quite finished the cap ball mechanism enough for it to run well on the robot. We ran into several problems. How were we to hold and release the cap ball? This, in turn, presented the question of how to wire such a mechanism. The drawer slides were too wiggly and the arms for the ball too flimsy. The mechanism, once temporarily put on the robot, made our robot too heavy to use our mecanum wheels very well, compromising our driving. These problems were discussed and, finally, we painfully came to the conclusion that we should not mount the cap ball mechanism on the robot because it would probably not be of good enough quality to compete with other robots that had developed their cap ball mechanisms over the whole season. In addition, if we put it on, it might compromise our performance in other areas, due to its weight. Thus, in a very close vote, we chose to continue on to Worlds without this last mechanism.

#### The World Chapionship

At Worlds, we endured both difficulty and success. Our first few matches were riddled with phone disconnects, other electronic problems, and issues with our drive train. This caused us to lose our first two matches, despite the opposing alliance having relatively low scores. It was a bad start to our last tournament. We did our best to fix our issues during the intense pressure of the competition. After fixing most of these issues, we won the rest of our qualification matches, even the one against Rednek Robotics, the future champions of the world!

After the qualifications matches finished, we were ranked 7th in our division, the same rank we got at Supers. After much nail-biting, we were picked as the second pick of the 3rd seed alliance! Unfortunately, our alliance was just not strong enough to beat the 2nd seed alliance, who went on to become the world champions. All in all, it was an amazing experience, and we were excited by just how well we had done, especially for a 2nd-year team!
