This season was a complete new generation of Brainstormz.
Over half of our previous team graduated and we have many new members.

# Robot Version 1.0

________________________________________________________________________________________________________
We started out the season really well with our sample robot version 1.0 for meet 0 and 1.
# Robot Version 2.0

________________________________________________________________________________________________________
We completely changed our robot to try to make collecting samples faster with robot version 2.0 in meet 2 and 3.
# Robot Version 3.0

________________________________________________________________________________________________________
We decided that our old design was too front heavy and it kept tipping over so we made our version 3.0. We also switched from a sample scoring robot to a specimen scoring robot. This was used in ILTs and regionals.
# Robot Version 3.5

________________________________________________________________________________________________________
We will be adding two cameras on our robot to detect samples, specimens, and april tags to make our matches more efficient and accurate. This version 4.0 will be used for Worlds.

We also broke the state record at regionals with a score of 437 points!!!
